  ## Description

 This is a note taker application that uses Express.js to establish basic server routes between the back end of the app to the front end. Enter a note into the application, and through a route created with Express.js, it will be saved in the back end and retrieved at the same time to be displayed on the client side of the app using POST and GET requests, respectively.
